#supernanovol

Supernanovol is a GPU-based renderer for visualizing atomistic datasets. It is intended mostly for visualizing materials 
science simulations such as molecular dynamics and density functional theory. 

The main feature of supernanovol is that is supports rendering of balls and volumes, simultaneously. The volume can be
used to illustrate charge density in the space around atoms, or it can be used to plot a sort of a material surface
to illustrate material interfaces, among other things.

#supernanovol

Supernanovol is a GPU-based renderer for visualizing atomistic datasets. It is intended mostly for visualizing materials 
science simulations such as molecular dynamics and density functional theory. 

The main feature of supernanovol is that is supports rendering of balls (i.e., atoms) and volumes, simultaneously. The volume can be used to illustrate charge density in the space around atoms or atom density. Alternatively, it can be used to plot "volumetric surfaces" to illustrate material interfaces, among other things.
